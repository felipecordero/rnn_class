    Chapter 3: Deep Belief Network (DBN)
1. Introduction to Deep Belief Networks (DBN)

Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are generative models composed of multiple layers of hidden units.
They are constructed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are stacked to form a deep structure.
RBMs serve as the building blocks of DBNs and are a special type of Boltzmann Machines (BMs), which belong to the family of Markov Random Fields (MRFs).

Boltzmann Machines (BMs)

A Boltzmann Machine is a stochastic neural network consisting of symmetrically connected binary units.
It is used to learn probability distributions over data.

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

RBMs are a special case of Boltzmann Machines with a restricted architecture:

No intra-layer connections (i.e., no connections between neurons in the same layer).
Composed of:

Visible units: $ v \in {0,1}^D $
Hidden units: $ h \in {0,1}^D $





Why Use DBNs?

DBNs solve the difficulty in training deep neural networks by:

Pretraining each layer independently as an RBM.
Using a greedy layer-wise training approach to initialize deep networks efficiently.
Improving a lower bound on the likelihood with each additional layer.




2. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
Structure of an RBM

RBMs consist of:

A visible layer containing observed data.
A hidden layer capturing latent features.
A weight matrix ( W ) connecting visible and hidden units.
Bias terms ( a ) and ( b ) for visible and hidden layers, respectively.

A hidden layer capturing latent features. A weight matrix ( W ) connecting visible and hidden units. Bias terms ( a ) and ( b ) for visible and hidden layers, respectively. Energy Function of an RBM The energy function for an RBM is defined as:\n$$ E(v, h) = - v^T W h - a^T v - b^T h $$\nwhere:\n( W ) is the weight matrix. ( a ) is the bias vector for visible units. ( b ) is the bias vector for hidden units. Probability Distributions in RBMs The joint probability distribution is given by: $$ P(v, h) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(-E(v, h)) $$\nwhere ( Z ) is the partition function:\n$$ Z = \\sum_{v,h} \\exp(-E(v, h)) $$\nThe marginal probability of visible units: $$ P(v) = \\sum_h P(v, h) $$\n3. Inference in DBNs Exact Inference Exact inference is generally intractable because: The latent space is high-dimensional. The posterior distribution is complex and difficult to compute directly. Approximated Inference (Sampling) To estimate expectations efficiently, sampling methods are used: Basic Sampling - Transformation Method Generates samples using a transformation function. Basic Sampling - Rejection Sampling Uses a proposal distribution to generate samples and rejects unlikely ones. Gibbs Sampling A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method where each variable is sampled conditionally. Gibbs Sampling for RBMs Used to approximate ( P(v) ).\nEach step involves:\nUpdating one variable ( z_i ) while keeping others fixed: $$ p(z_i | z_{\\setminus i}) $$\nExample Process:\nStart with an initial state ( (v_0, h_0) ). Iteratively update the state using conditional probabilities. 4. Learning in RBMs Maximum Likelihood Learning Learning is done by maximizing the likelihood function: $$ \\max_{w_{ij}, a_i, b_j} \\sum_{l=1}^{m} \\log \\sum_{h} P(v^l, h^l) $$\nThe gradient of the log-likelihood: $$ \\frac{\\partial \\log P(v)}{\\partial W_{ij}} = \\langle v_i h_j \\rangle_{\\text{data}} - \\langle v_i h_j \\rangle_{\\text{model}} $$\nContrastive Divergence (CD) Algorithm: A sampling-based approximation for computing the gradient efficiently. 5. Deep Belief Networks (DBN) Greedy Layer-Wise Training DBNs use a layer-wise training approach: Train the first RBM using input data. Use the activations from the trained RBM as input to the next RBM. Repeat the process for each subsequent layer. DBN Feature Generation A DBN can extract hierarchical features from data. Example: Architecture: 784-1000-500-250-30 Each layer learns a higher-level representation. DBN Applications Feature Learning Dimensionality Reduction Image Reconstruction Classification Tasks (e.g., fingerprint recognition) 6. Classification Using DBNs DBNs can be used for image classification and biometric recognition. Example: Fingerprint liveness detection. Determines whether a fingerprint is real or fake before recognition. Advantages of DBNs in Classification Efficient training using pretraining Captures deep feature representations Generalizes well across different datasets Summary of Key Equations Concept Equation Energy Function $$ E(v, h) = - v^T W h - a^T v - b^T h $$ Joint Probability $$ P(v, h) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(-E(v, h)) $$ Partition Function $$ Z = \\sum_{v,h} \\exp(-E(v, h)) $$ Marginal Probability $$ P(v) = \\sum_h P(v, h) $$ Gradient Update for Learning $$ \\frac{\\partial \\log P(v)}{\\partial W_{ij}} = \\langle v_i h_j \\rangle_{\\text{data}} - \\langle v_i h_j \\rangle_{\\text{model}} $$ Conclusion This chapter covers Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and their foundation in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The key takeaways are:\nRBMs serve as the building blocks of DBNs. DBNs use a layer-wise training approach. Learning in RBMs is done using Maximum Likelihood and Contrastive Divergence.
